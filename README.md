##THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS THE *GETFLAG* SCRIPT FOR THE CHALLENGES IN CTFlearn

hello people,

I created a getFlag script for the [CTFlearn](https://ctflearn.com/) challenges

I din't done a writeup for every challenges coz it's time consuming and I sucks in explaining stuff..+_+

But i wrote the getFlag script in a more understandable way (kinda like a beginner version) 

So you can probably understand it just by go throughing it.

NOTE: 
	  
	  The programs are either in `bash` or `python` 

      And to make the getFlag script to work you should keep the contents of the challenges as it as

	  I mean you should not change the name of files and so on...

	  it is better to run the script in a separate directory as some scripts contains `rm` keyword

Happy exploring :)
